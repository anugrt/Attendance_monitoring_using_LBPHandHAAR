#Attendance_monitoring_using_LBPHandHAAR
Overview
This project utilizes Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Haar Cascades for attendance monitoring. It employs computer vision techniques to detect faces, recognize them using LBP, and track attendance.

Features
Multiple Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascades to detect faces in images or video streams.
Face Recognition: Implements LBP for recognizing faces detected.
Attendance Tracking: Keeps track of attendance based on recognized faces.

Attendance Monitoring Using LBP and Haar Cascades
Overview
This project utilizes Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Haar Cascades for attendance monitoring. It employs computer vision techniques to detect faces, recognize them using LBP, and track attendance.

Features
Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascades to detect faces in images or video streams.
Face Recognition: Implements LBP for recognizing faces detected.
Attendance Tracking: Keeps track of attendance based on recognized faces.
Installation
Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, etc. You can install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Dataset: Prepare a dataset of faces for training the LBP recognizer.
Training: Train the LBP recognizer using the prepared dataset.
Run: Execute the main script to start attendance monitoring.


Usage
Data Preparation: Organize a dataset of images containing faces. Each person should have a separate folder with multiple images of their face.
Training: Train the LBP recognizer using the prepared dataset to generate a face model.
Run: Execute the main script to start monitoring attendance. The script will detect faces in real-time, recognize them using the trained LBP model, and track attendance accordingly.

The dataset used are privately created
